          Dark Eye: The Journey Beyond

    STORY:

    An archer (green guy) and a swordsman (blue guy) decide to go on an adventure in the
    land of Solid Primary Colours to find the Magical and/or Valuable sceptre.

    However a rogue prince has built different coloured walls which can only be destroyed
    by special arrows and several red bad dudes have also been seen in the area.



    GAME:

    I apologise in advance for the horribly bad programmer art.

    To run this game you will need 'ddraw.dll' (for DirectDraw 7) and 'dinput.dll'
    (DirectInput 8) and hopefully nothing i forgot to include in the ZIP. Also, all
    .bmp files should be in a subdirectory called Data, but unless you did something
    stupid, they probably already are.



    CONTROLS:

    This game is mostly controlled with the mouse, but there is a handy in game help
    screen to tell you any other controls.



    LEGAL:

    By installing/playing this game you agree not to sue me over any damages caused by
    viewing my horrible programmer art...
